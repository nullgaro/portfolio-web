# Portfolio Web

> An elegant personal portfolio showcasing your work, built with Astro and Tailwind CSS.

## Description

Minimalist and modern personal portfolio website created to showcase my projects and experience. This project uses **Astro** for static site generation and **Tailwind CSS** for stylish and responsive design. The style has been inspired in [Midu's portfolio](https://github.com/midudev/porfolio.dev) but done from scratch and adding new functionallities.

The website includes sections for:
- **Hero**: A brief introduction.
- **Experience**: My professional experience.
- **Projects**: Highlights of key projects with links and descriptions.
- **About Me**: A more personal and detailed description about me
